# RCP-Room-Controls-Panel

## Description

RCP-Room-Controls-Panel is an advanced, fully customizable script designed to provide enhanced room management and moderation tools for MultiPlayerPiano (MPP). This script builds upon the popular CMB - Custom MPP Buttons by introducing more refined controls and aesthetic personalization features. It aims to give room hosts greater authority and flexibility over room settings, participant behavior, and the overall visual design of the interface.

RCP is essential for users who frequently host rooms and require a seamless way to manage room access, enforce participation rules, and moderate users directly from the interface. The script allows hosts to easily adjust permissions, limit access for bots or guests, and enforce chat and piano rules without complicated commands.

## Key Functionalities

The RCP-Room-Controls-Panel is divided into three main categories, providing extensive control over different aspects of the room:

### 1. Room Settings Control (Part 1)

- Room Access Management:
  - Permanent Access Control – Allow or deny access to the room indefinitely.
  - Temporary Access Control – Restrict access for a specific period or event.
- Chat Access:
  - Toggle chat availability for all users.
  - Set temporary chat bans or open chat access for limited periods.
- Piano Access:
  - Grant or deny access to the piano.
  - Temporarily block users from interacting with the piano.

### 2. Room Settings Control (Part 2)

- Bot Access Management:
  - Allow or restrict bots from entering the room.
  - Useful for preventing bot spam or limiting automated scripts.

- Room Limit Controls:
  - Set participant limits permanently or temporarily.
  - Enforce dynamic entry limits that adjust based on room activity.

- Room Color Customization:
  - Permanently change room colors to fit different moods or themes
  - Apply temporary color shifts that reset after a certain period.

### 3. Room Participants Control

- Moderation and Security Tools:
  - Ban Users – Permanently remove disruptive users.
  - Unban Users – Restore access to previously banned users.
  - Kick Users – Instantly remove users by issuing a "0-minute ban." This is a soft ban that ejects users without long-term consequences.

## Customization and Visual Adjustments

One of the standout features of RCP is the ability to fully customize the appearance of the control panels. This ensures that room hosts can tailor the interface to match their personal preferences or the room's aesthetic.

### Appearance Settings:

- Panel Background Color – Set custom colors for the main control panels.

- Panel Header Color – Change the header color to differentiate sections.

- Text and Button Customization:

  - Change button colors to enhance visibility and usability.

- Border Radius Adjustments – Round panel and button edges for a smoother appearance.
